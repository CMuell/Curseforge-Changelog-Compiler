With Forge, you're never supposed to call System.exit. It won't work anyway

can't just propagate: wrap it in an unchecked exception.

    -  fix broken cartrige recipes, I blame datatypes


    -  Fix fluid tooltips JEI


    -  fixes the auto-genned recipes, removed the manual ones added last commit

Currently seems to have a bug where it registers the ingot rolling twice
though.


    -  fixes a bunch of missing rolling machine recipes.


    -  Add more documention to ASM calls


    -  Fixes #860


    -  Fix ASM mappings for 1.12.2

Also cleans up some un-needed imports.

    -  re-arrange some ore dictionary and recipe stuff.

this fixes an issue with precision assembler ore dictionary support for

    -  fixes some ore registry locations.

This was causing some crashes due to where libvulpes registers items in
the item registry events.  Should probably move the item and block
registrtations here to the proper events as well.


    -  fixes crashing while loading dedicated server, fixes some gravity issues

fixes double gravity on overworld on dedicated servers, this fix might
need to be reworked if ASM is used again for non-item gravity.


    -  cleanup access transformers.

Will figure out which will be needed later, currently Entity * seems to
be sufficient in my tests.


    -  remove some debug spam.


    -  implement recipes for 1.12


    -  make non-item gravity use update event instead of asm


    -  initial update for 1.12


    -  fix changelog
