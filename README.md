# Curseforge Changelog Compiler

This script scrapes changelogs from curseforge for any jars that are different in the new mod directory. The changelogs are then dumped in the file changelog.html

***

#### Current To Do:

- `done` ~~Add html tag stripping option, filter irrelevant changelogs that are output to changelog.html~~
- `80% done` Standardize changelog.html styling -- minimal style processing is currently occuring
- Add optional json output file
